# Process

This document describes the practices we use when developing and maintaining Apso.

## Pull requests

We encourage contributions to be in the form of pull requests. We keep track of a [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md) but it's not
expected for pull requests to eagerly update it. The [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md) should instead be updated prior to a
[release](PROCESS.md#releasing).

## Versioning

We try to adopt _MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH_ [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/):

* _PATCH_ version Z (x.y.Z) is incremented if only backwards compatible bug fixes are introduced.
* _MINOR_ version Y (x.Y.z) is incremented if new, binary backwards compatible functionality is introduced to the public
  API. A source breaking but binary compatible change is allowed between _MINOR_ versions.
* _MAJOR_ version X (X.y.z) is incremented if new binary backward breaking changes are introduced.

## Releasing

### Prepare the release

Before releasing, create, if it doesn't exist yet, a [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md) entry for the version you're releasing,
following the template. 

To figure out what to include in the Changelog, you can check the timestamp of the last tag like the following
(replacing the actual tag name):

```bash
$ git show -s --format=%ci v0.23.0 | cat
tag v0.23.0
Tagger: Beatriz MagalhaÌƒes <bmagalhaes@kevel.com>

Release 0.23.0
2025-06-09 16:32:51 +0100
```

Then, you can use the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) to list the actual PRs (replacing the timestamp with the
timestamp of the tag obtained above):

```bash
$ gh pr list --limit 100 --state merged --search "base:master merged:>2025-06-09T16:32:51+0100" --json title,url,number --template '{{range .}}- {{.title}} ([#{{.number}}]({{.url}})).{{"\n"}}{{end}}' | tac
```

Additionally, the version needs to be updated in the documentation to the one being released. To do this, update the
`mdoc` variable `VERSION` in [build.sbt](build.sbt) and run `sbt docs/mdoc`.

It's recommended to open a PR with the Changelog changes so that they can be reviewed by someone else from the team.

### Releasing artifacts

To release the artifacts in the Sonatype's release repository, which eventually gets synced to
[Maven Central](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/kevel), simply use `sbt` to run `release`.

This will result in the releasing of all the `apso-*` libraries. Please ensure you are using Java 11 when releasing
new versions.
